# PDF Merger

This Python script allows you to merge multiple PDF files into a single one. 

## Prerequisites

You will need Python 3 and the PyPDF2 library to run this script.

## Installation

To install the required library, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
```

## Usage

Place the PDF files that you want to merge into a folder named 'pdf' in the same directory as the script.

To run the script, use the following command in a terminal:

```bash
python merge_pdfs.py
```


The merged PDF file will be created in the same directory as the script, with the name 'output.pdf'.

Please note that this script will merge PDF files in alphabetical order based on their filenames.
